## 📖 Overview

![InternAgent](/images/internagent_overall.png)

InternAgent can support **12** types of scientific research tasks ranging from the AI field to the science field, including reaction yield prediction, molecular dynamics, power flow estimation, time series forecasting, transcription prediction, enhancer activity prediction, sentiment classification, 2D image classification, 3D point classification, 2D semantic segmentation, 3D autonomous driving, large vision-language model fine-tuning.

## 🌟 Core Features

![Framework](/images/internagent_framework.png)

InternAgent covers three main capabilities: (1) **Self-evolving idea generation with human-interactive feedback**, (2) **Idea-to-methodology construction**, and (3) **Evolutionary experimental planning and execution**. 

It is a unified, closed-loop multi-agent system designed to automate and accelerate innovative research across scientific domains. Through intelligent agent collaboration, our system enables **end-to-end automation** from idea generation and methodology construction to experimental execution, dramatically enhancing research efficiency and creativity.

### 💡 Self-Evolving Idea Generation with Human-Interactive Feedback
- Autonomous generation, selection, and evolution of innovative research ideas through multi-agent collaboration
- Supports interactive human feedback, enabling continuous refinement of ideas with expert insights
- Dynamically integrates literature, code, and domain knowledge to inspire diverse innovation pathways

### 🏗️ Idea-to-Methodology Construction
- Systematically transforms creative ideas into actionable and verifiable research methodologies
- Integrates baseline code, literature, and expert knowledge to automatically generate comprehensive methodological frameworks

## 🚀 How to use the early version, Dolphin?

### Installation

```
conda create -n dolphin python=3.11
conda activate dolphin

# Install PyPI requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Auto-Research using Dolphin

```shell
bash launch_dolphin.sh

# modify launch_dolphin.py line # line 189 if round > 0
# exp_base_file_list = [List your exp dir] 
```

- Note that you need to add api_key and specify the model and topic in `launch_dolphin.sh`. You can refer to the [doc](./docs/ollama_doc.md) if you want to use self-deployed model.
- Data for Point Classfication, Image Classification, and Sentiment Classification tasks can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mq1y7EWW9dgPlS26hXNa3wxL7_2vvNju?usp=sharing).
