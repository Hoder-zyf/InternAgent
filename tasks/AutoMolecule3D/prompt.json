    "background": "### 1. **Observations and Initial Hypotheses**  \nKey Observations:  \n- Existing geometric deep learning models faced a trade-off:  \n  - **Group representation-based methods** (e.g., NequIP, Allegro) achieved high accuracy but incurred prohibitive computational costs from high-order geometric tensors and Clebsch-Gordan products.  \n  - **Directional message-passing methods** (e.g., PaiNN, ET) had lower complexity but underutilized geometric features like dihedral angles and improper angles critical for molecular force fields.  \n- Classical molecular dynamics (MD) force fields rely on angles, dihedrals, and improper angles, but explicit extraction of these features in neural networks led to \\(O(N^3)\\) complexity for large systems.  \n\nInitial Hypotheses:  \n- **Hypothesis 1**: Implicit extraction of high-order geometric features (angles, dihedrals) with linear complexity could balance accuracy and efficiency.  \n- **Hypothesis 2**: A vector-scalar interactive message-passing (ViS-MP) mechanism could fully exploit geometric information while maintaining SE(3)-equivariance.  \n\nPreliminary Evidence:  \n- Prior work (e.g., PaiNN) demonstrated that vector embeddings could encode directional information, but angular features were limited to pairwise interactions.  \n- Classical force fields validated the necessity of angular and dihedral terms for accurate energy/force prediction.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Methodological Reasoning and Evolution**  \n#### **Runtime Geometry Calculation (RGC)**  \n**Key Equations:**  \n1. **Direction Unit**:  \n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{v}_i = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_{ij}\\|}\n   \\]  \n   Captures angular information through inner products:  \n   \\[\n   \\|\\mathbf{v}_i\\|^2 = \\sum_{j,k} \\cos \\theta_{jik}\n   \\]  \n2. **Dihedral Angles via Vector Rejection**:  \n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{w}_{ij} = \\text{Rej}_{\\mathbf{u}_{ij}}(\\mathbf{v}_i), \\quad \\mathbf{w}_{ji} = \\text{Rej}_{\\mathbf{u}_{ji}}(\\mathbf{v}_j)\n   \\]  \n   Inner product \\(\\langle \\mathbf{w}_{ij}, \\mathbf{w}_{ji} \\rangle\\) encodes dihedral angles.  \n\n**Progression of Ideas**:  \n- **Step 1**: Replace explicit angular/dihedral calculations with vector operations (linear complexity).  \n- **Step 2**: Extend to spherical harmonics for higher-order geometric tensors without Clebsch-Gordan products:  \n  \\[\n  P_l(\\cos \\theta_{jik}) = \\sum_{m} Y_{l,m}(\\mathbf{u}_{ij}) Y_{l,m}^*(\\mathbf{u}_{ik})\n  \\]  \n  This avoids explicit high-order tensor products.  \n\n#### **Vector-Scalar Interactive Message Passing (ViS-MP)**  \n**Key Equations**:  \n1. **Scalar-to-Vector Interaction**:  \n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{m}_i^l = \\phi_s^m(h_i^l, h_j^l, f_{ij}^l), \\quad \\Delta \\mathbf{v}_i^{l+1} = \\phi_v^{\\text{un}}(\\mathbf{v}_i^l, \\mathbf{m}_i^l)\n   \\]  \n2. **Vector-to-Scalar Interaction**:  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta h_i^{l+1} = \\phi_s^{\\text{un}}(h_i^l, \\mathbf{v}_i^l \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_i^l)\n   \\]  \n\n**Logical Refinement**:  \n- **Motivation**: Prior models (e.g., GemNet) explicitly extracted angles/dihedrals at \\(O(N^2)\\) complexity. ViS-MP implicitly encodes these via equivariant vector-scalar interactions.  \n- **Ablation Studies** (Supplementary Table S3): Removing angle/dihedral terms degraded performance, validating their necessity.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Insights and Future Directions**  \n**Key Interpretations**:  \n1. **Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-Off**: ViSNet resolved the conflict via RGC's linear-time geometric encoding and ViS-MP's equivariant interactions.  \n2. **Scalability**: Success on Chignolin (166 atoms) and MD22 (370 atoms) demonstrated applicability to biomolecules.  \n\n**Future Directions**:  \n1. **Periodic Systems**: Extend ViSNet to materials with periodic boundary conditions.  \n2. **Higher-Order Tensors**: Address GWL test limitations by incorporating Clebsch-Gordan products selectively.  \n\n**Critical Analysis**:  \n- **Strength**: Rigorous validation across small/large molecules and quantum/MD benchmarks.  \n- **Limitation**: Reliance on inner products for geometric features may fail to distinguish reflection-symmetric structures.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe authors systematically addressed the trade-off between geometric expressivity and computational cost through:  \n1. **RGC**: Linear-time implicit encoding of angles/dihedrals via vector operations.  \n2. **ViS-MP**: Equivariant interaction mechanism enabling full utilization of geometric features.  \nExperimental validation across diverse benchmarks (MD17, QM9, Chignolin) and ablation studies solidified ViSNet's advancements, positioning it as a versatile tool for molecular modeling.",
