    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.",
    "task_description": "Your task is to develop a predictive method for genomics enhancer activity. You need to focus on improving the model design. You can refer to advanced deep learning methods, refer to the ways humans understand DNA sequences, etc. The model should take DNA sequences (typically 200bp) as input and output a numerical value representing the enhancer activity. The performance of the model will be evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), specifically for predicting the activity of developmental and housekeeping enhancers."
