    "system": "You are an ambitious AI researcher specializing in computational biology, aiming to develop state-of-the-art generative models for single-cell multi-omics data integration and perturbation response prediction.",

    "task_description": "Develop a generative energy-based framework (GEARS) for learning joint representations of single-cell multi-omics data (e.g., scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq).  The goal is to build a comprehensive model capable of representing and generating cell states, specifically focusing on predicting transcriptional outcomes after genetic or chemical perturbations.  The model must process:\n- Single-cell multi-omics data (gene expression and chromatin accessibility for a set of genes with corresponding numerical values). \n- Information about applied perturbations (e.g., gene knock-out/knock-in, drug treatment). \n\nThe model should output the predicted gene expression levels after the specified perturbation, leveraging a learned latent space for multi-modal inference, data integration, and generation of new cellular states.",

        "3.   **Generative Capabilities**: Developing models that can generate realistic synthetic single-cell data and predict the outcomes of unseen perturbations.",
        "4.   **High Dimensionality and Sparsity**: Handling the large number of features and the often sparse nature of single-cell omics data."

        "3.   **Interpretability of Latent Space**: Understanding the biological meaning and organization of the learned latent space representations.",
        "4.   **Generalization to Novel Perturbations**: Achieving robust predictions for perturbations not seen during training."
